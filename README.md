Utilities to use HCP data with nilearn



## External data

The default surface meshes for 3D visualization come from the group average of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 1200 Subjects (S1200) data release (March 2017) processed using HCP pipelines. They can be obtained on BALSA: https://balsa.wustl.edu/reference/show/pkXDZ 


These group average files are redistributed under the HCP Open Access Data Use Terms https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/wu-minn-hcp-consortium-open-access-data-use-terms with the acknowledgment: 

*"Data were provided [in part] by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University."*
